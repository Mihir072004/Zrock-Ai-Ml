# Zrock Temparature
Dashboard Presents

Overall Purpose:

The dashboard appears to present historical temperature data, likely for a specific location. It provides an overview of average temperatures across different time periods, including annual, seasonal, and decadal averages.

Key Components:

Average of Post Monsoon:

Displays the average temperature after the monsoon season.
Value: 28.53 (units are not explicitly mentioned, but likely degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit)
Yearly Temperature Averages:

Presents average temperatures for:
Annual: 29.18
Maximum: 35.84
Minimum: 22.00
Summer: 31.54
Winter: 24.63
Monsoon: 31.20
Decadal Temperature Averages:

Shows average temperatures for each decade from 1901-1910 to 2011-2017.
Values are represented by colored bars, with higher values indicated by darker shades.
Additional Elements:

A dropdown menu labeled "YEAR" likely allows for filtering data by specific years.
Buttons with icons suggest functionalities like exporting data, refreshing, and potentially additional options.
Interpretation:

Without specific context about the location, it's challenging to provide a detailed analysis. However, some general observations can be made:

Temperatures appear to have increased over the decades, as evidenced by the trend in the decadal average chart.
The region likely experiences significant seasonal variations, with summer being the hottest and winter the coldest period.
Possible Enhancements:

Adding units to temperature values (e.g., degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit) would improve clarity.
Including a graph or line chart to visualize the decadal temperature trend over time could provide additional insights.
Adding a comparison line for average global temperatures could help contextualize the local data.


1St Screen Presents

Purpose:

The dashboard visualizes the average annual temperature trends from 1901 to 2017.

Key Components:

Title: Average Of Annual Temperature
Subtitle: Temperature of 1901 - 2017
X-axis: Represents years, from 1900 to 2020 with major ticks every 20 years.
Y-axis: Represents temperature, with values ranging from 28 to 32.
Line Chart: Shows the fluctuation of average annual temperature over the years.
Data Points: Circular markers on the line chart, indicating the average temperature for each year.
Data Labels: Numerical values displayed near some data points, representing specific temperature values.
Dropdown: Allows filtering the data by year (currently set to "All").
Interpretation:

The dashboard primarily aims to showcase the historical temperature pattern over a century. Key observations include:

Overall Trend: A general upward trend in average annual temperature is evident, suggesting a warming climate over the period.
Fluctuations: While there's an upward trend, there are year-to-year variations in temperature.
Data Granularity: The chart provides a yearly view of temperature, allowing for detailed analysis. 

2nd Screen Presents

Purpose
The dashboard presents a visual representation of average seasonal temperatures over a period of time. It specifically focuses on two categories:

Average of Summer and Winter by Year
Average of Post Monsoon and Monsoon by Year
Components
Title: Average Of Seasonal Temparature
Subtitles: Indicate the specific season combination being analyzed.
Line Charts: Two line charts, one for each seasonal combination, displaying temperature variations over the years.
X-axis: Represents years, with specific year values labeled.
Y-axis: Represents temperature, with numerical values indicating temperature levels.
Data Points: Points on the line charts representing average temperatures for each year.
Data Labels: Numerical values displayed near some data points, indicating specific temperature values.
Interpretation
The dashboard provides a clear overview of temperature trends for the specified seasons. Key observations include:

Seasonal Variations: The two line charts highlight the temperature differences between summer/winter and post-monsoon/monsoon.
Year-to-Year Fluctuations: Both charts show variations in average temperatures from year to year.
Temperature Ranges: The y-axis values indicate the overall temperature range for the analyzed periods.

3rd Screen Presents

Purpose
The dashboard presents a visual overview of average temperatures over ten-year periods (decades) from 1901 to 2017.

Components
Title: Average Of Decadal Temperature
Subtitle: Decadal Temperature Average
Horizontal Bars: Represents each decade, with the length suggesting the time period covered.
Color: Each bar is assigned a distinct color for visual differentiation.
Temperature Values: Numerical values are displayed within each bar, indicating the average temperature for that decade.
Legend: A list of decades with corresponding colors for reference.
Interpretation
The dashboard provides a clear and concise overview of temperature trends over the past century. Key observations include:

Temperature Increase: There appears to be a general upward trend in temperatures over the decades, suggesting a warming climate.
Decadal Variations: Temperature fluctuations are visible between different decades.
Visual Impact: The use of color and length effectively communicates temperature changes over time.
